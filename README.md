# Adult Obesity and Food Environment Index
## Purpose
#### This repository was created for Professor Gotzler's English 105 course at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
## What's included?
#### It includes a [data set](https://github.com/morganbligh/english105adultobesity/blob/main/Northeast_subset%20(1).csv) that has the rates of adult obesity and the food environment index of different states in the Northeast region of the US. The food environment index is a measure of accessibility to healthy food, this includes distance to grocery stores containing healthy food as well as cost barriers and other factors. This data is compiled from a larger data set of [county health data across the US](https://github.com/morganbligh/english105adultobesity/blob/main/CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv) from 2014-2015. 
## How was it done?
#### This repository also includes a [Python notebook](https://github.com/morganbligh/english105adultobesity/blob/main/codingprocessnotebook.ipynb) that details how the Northeast subset was isolated from the larger data set. In order to replicate and reproduce the data set in this repository, please reference the Python notebook for instructions.
## Possible Uses
- This data subset could be useful in finding a correlation, or lack of correlation, between the food environment index and adult obesity rates in the Northeast region of the US.
- It could also be useful in drawing conclusions about which Northeastern states are healthier than others or have better food environment indexes.
