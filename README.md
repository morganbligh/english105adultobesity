# Adult Obesity and Food Environment Index
## About
### This repository was created for Professor Gotzler's English 105 course at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. It includes a data set that has the rates of adult obesity and the food environment index of different states in the Northeast region of the US. The data is compiled from a larger data set of [county health data across the US](https://github.com/morganbligh/english105adultobesity/blob/main/CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv) from 2014-2015. This repository also includes a [Python notebook](https://github.com/morganbligh/english105adultobesity/blob/main/CountyHeatlhData.ipynb) that details how the Northeast subset was isolated from the larger data set.
