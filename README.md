# Adult Obesity and Food Environment Index
## About
#### This repository was created for Professor Gotzler's English 105 course at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
#### It includes a [data set](https://github.com/morganbligh/english105adultobesity/blob/main/Northeast_subset%20(1).csv) that has the rates of adult obesity and the food environment index of different states in the Northeast region of the US. The food environment index is a measure of accessibility to healthy food, this includes distance to grocery stores containing healthy food as well as cost barriers and other factors. This data is compiled from a larger data set of [county health data across the US](https://github.com/morganbligh/english105adultobesity/blob/main/CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv) from 2014-2015. 
#### This repository also includes a [Python notebook](https://github.com/morganbligh/english105adultobesity/blob/main/CountyHeatlhData.ipynb) that details how the Northeast subset was isolated from the larger data set.
## Possible Uses
#### This data subset could be useful in finding a correlation, or lack of correlation, between the food environment index and adult obesity rates in the Northeast region of the US.
#### It could also be useful in drawing conclusions about which Northeastern states are healthier than others or have better food environment indexes.
